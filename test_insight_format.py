üìä **Distribution Analysis: sales_amount**

**Statistical Properties:**
‚Ä¢ Data points: 1,000
‚Ä¢ Mean: 2,456.78
‚Ä¢ Median: 2,200.00
‚Ä¢ Standard deviation: 892.45
‚Ä¢ Skewness: 0.85
‚Ä¢ Kurtosis: 2.31

**Distribution Shape:**
‚Ä¢ Right-skewed (tail extends right)
‚Ä¢ Normal-like tail behavior

**Key Insights:**
‚Ä¢ Consider log transformation for right-skewed data to improve normality
‚Ä¢ Potential outliers detected in the tails - investigate extreme values
‚Ä¢ Distribution characteristics help determine appropriate statistical methods

**Next Steps:**
‚Ä¢ Use distribution shape to guide data preprocessing and transformation choices
‚Ä¢ Consider normalization or standardization if distribution is heavily skewed
‚Ä¢ Monitor for consistency in production data to detect distribution drift
